Description: Contains functions to query and visualize the Neuroimaging features 
  associated with genetically regulated gene expression (GReX). The primary utility,
  neuroimaGene(), relies on a list of user-defined genes and returns a table of
  neuroimaging features (NIDPs) associated with each gene. This resource 
  is designed to assist in the interpretation of genome-wide and transcriptome-wide
  association studies that evaluate brain related traits. Bledsoe (2024) 
  <doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2024.06.002>. In addition there are several visualization 
  functions that generate summary plots and 2-dimensional visualizations of regional 
  brain measures. Mowinckel (2020).
